# The Job Protal Website üìù

In this project, I use `React`, `Tailwind CSS`,
and `Vite` to build a Job Portal. The portal
allows job seekers to browse and apply for job
listings, while employers can post job openings
and manage applicants. The use of React ensures
a dynamic user interface, while Tailwind CSS
simplifies styling and allows for easy
customization. Vite is used as a build tool to
optimize the project's performance and speed up
development.

## Started With This Project üöÄ

To get started with this project, begin by
cloning the repository. Next, install all
required dependencies by running the command `npm
i`. Once the installation is complete, you can
start the project by running `npm run dev`. This
will launch the development server, allowing you
to explore the React code and customize it to suit
your needs. Wishing you a productive and enjoyable
development experience!üòä

## Functionalities üî•

- **Home Page:** The home page is just like a landing page. It includes a section called "Featured Jobs" which displays four jobs. If a user clicks on the "see all" button, then they will be able to view all of the featured jobs.
- **Job Details:**
- **Applied Jobs:** The "Applied Jobs" page shows all the jobs that the user has already applied for. Additionally, there is a filter option available on this page where the user can sort their applied jobs based on job location.

## In conclusion ‚ú®

In this job portal built with React, Tailwind CSS,
and Vite offers powerful features like job search,
filter jobs, and apply jobs. This modern
front-end stack ensures a fast and responsive user
experience, while Vite optimizes builds. The portal
is valuable resource for job seekers and employers.
