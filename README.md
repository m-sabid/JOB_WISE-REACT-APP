# The Job Protal Website üìù

In this project, I use `React`, `Tailwind CSS`,
and `Vite` to build a Job Portal. The portal
allows job seekers to browse and apply for job
listings, while employers can post job openings
and manage applicants. The use of React ensures
a dynamic user interface, while Tailwind CSS
simplifies styling and allows for easy
customization. Vite is used as a build tool to
optimize the project's performance and speed up
development.

## Started With This Project üöÄ

To get started with this project, begin by
cloning the repository. Next, install all
required dependencies by running the command `npm
i`. Once the installation is complete, you can
start the project by running `npm run dev`. This
will launch the development server, allowing you
to explore the React code and customize it to suit
your needs. Wishing you a productive and enjoyable
development experience!üòä
